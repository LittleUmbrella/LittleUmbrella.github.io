# Purpose
This started as a prototype for a new UI paradigm, full of interactive components.  It was then adapted to a particular challenge of a Credit Union: staff using tablets at neighborhood financial centers, helping members in line, if their needs were simple.  The purpose was both to demonstrate the platform itself, and how it could solve a single business function:  staff changing addresses on behalf of members.
